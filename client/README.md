- **Hosting:** üî• [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Requirements

Requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher, and a running [api server](../server/README.md#local-dev)

## Develop App Locally

# Locally running (already default in app)
export API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

This code is deployed directly in Cloud Build steps, as seen in the root [`cloudbuild.yaml`](/cloudbuild.yaml), and [`provisioning/client.cloudbuild.yaml`](/provisioning/client.cloudbuild.yaml).

It can also be deployed by building an image [`provisioning/client-image.cloudbuild.yaml`](/provisioning/client-image.cloudbuild.yaml), and running as a Cloud Run job, which can be customised by environment variables (see [`docker-deploy.yaml`](docker-deploy.sh))


### Deploy Avocart version

Before executing the root `setup.sh` script, assign the `_PURCHASE_MODE` substitution with value `cart`in [`provisioning/client.cloudbuild.yaml`](/provisioning/client.cloudbuild.yaml) and [`provisioning/client-image.cloudbuild.yaml`](/provisioning/client-image.cloudbuild.yaml)
